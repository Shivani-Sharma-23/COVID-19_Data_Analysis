## COVID-19 Prediction Model

### Overview:
This repository contains a COVID-19 prediction model that leverages machine learning and data analysis to forecast the spread of the novel coronavirus. The model is built on real-world data, making it a valuable tool for tracking and predicting the progression of the pandemic.

### Features:
- Data collection and preprocessing: We collect and preprocess COVID-19 data from reliable sources, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.
- Machine learning models: We employ various machine learning algorithms to predict infection rates, hospitalization needs, and mortality rates, providing essential insights for healthcare professionals and policymakers.
- Visualization: Visualize predictions and historical data with intuitive graphs and charts for better understanding.

### Key Components:
- **Data Collection**: Python scripts for collecting and updating COVID-19 data.
- **Model Training**: Jupyter notebooks with machine learning models trained on historical data.
- **Visualization**: Python scripts and notebooks for creating informative graphs and charts.
- **API**: Expose prediction results via a simple API for integration with other applications.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository: 'https://github.com/Skillbasket/COVID-19_Data_Analysis.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the prediction model using Jupyter notebooks or utilize the API for programmatic access.
4. Visualize the results to gain insights into COVID-19 trends and predictions.
